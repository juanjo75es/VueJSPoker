# VueJSPoker
A single-user poker game in Vue.js

This is an exact copy of the ReactJS poker game [JJTSReactPoker](https://github.com/juanjo75es/JJTSReactPoker). About 95% of the code is exactly the same.
It took me around 3 days to complete the adaptation of the project from ReactJS to Vue.JS without any previous experience with Vue.js.
